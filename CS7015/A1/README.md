- https://wandb.ai/miteshk/assignments/reports/Assignment-1--VmlldzozNjk4NDE?accessToken=r7ndsh8lf4wlxyjln7phvvfb8ftvc0n4lyn4tiowdg06hhzpzfzki4jrm28wqh44
- The goal of this assignment is twofold: (i) implement and use gradient descent (and its variants) with backpropagation for a classification task (ii) get familiar with wandb which is a cool tool for running and keeping track of a large number of experiments
- We strongly recommend that you work on this assignment in a team of size 2. Both the members of the team are expected to work together (in a subsequent viva both members will be expected to answer questions, explain the code, etc).
- Collaborations and discussions with other groups are strictly prohibited.
- You must use Python (numpy and pandas) for your implementation.
- You cannot use the following packages from keras, pytorch, tensorflow: optimizers, layers
- If you are using any packages from keras, pytorch, tensorflow then post on moodle first to check with the instructor.
- You can run the code in a jupyter notebook on colab by enabling GPUs.
- You have to generate the report in the same format as shown below using wandb.ai. You can start by cloning this report using the clone option above. Most of the plots that we have asked for below can be (automatically) generated using the apis provided by wandb.ai. You will upload a link to this report on gradescope.
- You also need to provide a link to your github code as shown below. Follow good software engineering practices and set up a github repo for the project on Day 1. Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to github on the last day. The commits in github should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
- You have to check moodle regularly for updates regarding the assignment.
