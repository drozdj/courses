How will AI affect your job in 10 years time?
AI systems today are remarkably good at many tasks, though there are still many domains in which they cannot yet outperform humans.

In this exercise, you'll consider how much of your day-to-day work could be replaced or augmented by an AI system today, and how that might be different in 10 years time. You'll use these insights in your cohort's discussion to explore how AI could impact all of society.

(If you're not currently employed, either consider your most recent job, or the next job you think you'll have)

**Q: What type of tasks comprise most of your working hours? Take note of the different categories. How well do AI systems currently perform at those tasks?**
* dealing with general template emails
    * human-level performance *(if not better)*
* daily walkaround checks
    * human-level performance *(if not better)*
* dealing with clients (face-to-face)
    * available, but society hasn't yet adapted
* network building
    * available, but society hasn't yet adapted

**Q: Now imagine it's 2034. Based on the rate of improvement demonstrated in the resources, what might AI systems look like in 10 more years? How much better are our AI systems that can input and output images, videos, audio and text data (including code)? What long sequences of actions can they take via the internet - and maybe even in the real world?**
* many of the tedious repetitive jobs will be replaced by these AI systems. i genuinly believe that already such systems are avaiable but either due to a) fear from society or b) lack of ease-to-deploy, are the key factors why they haven't yet been put in place.

**Q: How much of your day-to-day work do you expect would now be possible by AI systems? How much of your friends and family's work will be affected?**
* without a doubt all of the below  
    * NHS nurse
    * Cleaning
    * Accounting for projects
    * Reception type role

**Q: How do you think this will affect your life, in terms of the work you're doing? If you'd find a different job, what jobs do you think might exist? If not, what would you do instead?**
* hopefully i make the transition to ai safety just in time! 
    * actually recognizing that we are now looking at black-boxes is disturbing, the fact we will let these black-boxes have so much control over all the jobs just covered is even more worrying. for this reason, i believe that the highest-leverage activity is to identify how NNs are outputting what they are.
