# Summarizing books with human feedback: blog post (Wu et al., 2021)

---

* OpenAI researchers felt lazy & couldn't be asked to read entire books as they took 'hours'
    * as a result they made a machine summarization tool that takes large texts and summarizes into a more compact form.
        * this can be re-applied depending on how high-level you would like to summary to be

* learned in multiple layers / depths, as can be seen in the [OpenAI summary explorer].
    * this is similar to the method that J. Sung presents [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlmRRSp2PoU), for humans though.
