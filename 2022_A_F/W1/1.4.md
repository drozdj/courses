# Future ML systems will be qualitatively different (Steinhardt, 2022)

---
* what is the article about?
    * that there are *phase transitions*, which are sharp and happen in a very rapid space of time.
        * (change in) storage happpend in 2015
        * (change in) compute happend in 2018
        * (change in) 2020
        * (change in) 2021
            * the argument is that as can be seen, the trend is for the gaps to close in as time goes on.  
    
    * as opposed to *emergence*, which gradually occur.
        * 

    * its arguing that we should expect different approaches as time goes on.
    * Steinhardt had given examples of how individual things are much different in nature than a collective of them.
        * car traffic jams -- easy to transport through a motorway in 10 minutes with 10,0000 cars, but if you have 20,000 cars it may take a hour.
        * uranium -- single piece is innocent, but tightly packed together you have a nuclear booomb 
        * wetness -- water particles themselves on fabric are not wet, but the collective makes it to be so. 
    * closely relates to { } whereby we should conside AGI systems that co-operate with one another to improve. what we humans know as the *collective*,
    and it is argued without this we would have no society.
